Simple and stylish image slider / gallery.

Made for edzerdillema.nl initially, but decided it might be useful for further projects as well. The slider is pretty basic, any image dimensions will work for the thumbnails, as long as the thumbnails have the same aspect ratio. Clicking a thumbnail will open a modal with a larges size image preview which can be any size or aspect ratio, and also allows the user to click on a link and open the full resolution image in a new tab.

The gallery displays over the full viewwidth of the browser by default but should be able to be used in other ways without too many modifications.

I realize that some things I did to make this work have been a bit redundant and the code could've been a bit cleaner but it works well in any browser, screen size and mobile platform. Fully responsive etc
